# hail mighty travelers, you have reached a quest board. However the board is written in
# the archaic language, something you reckon is called python3.
# the quests have a dictionary, with boss names and how much loot they give you.
# you must find the best boss to kill because you are the best!
#
# hint dictionaries have "keys" that map to "values". If i have a dictionary d, i can access its keys with 
# d.keys(). I can get its values with d.values(). If i do d['key in dictionary'], i will get the value 
# corresponding to 'key in dictionary'. keys need not be strings. You could just as easily have d[1] as a valid key.
# to get a list containing [(key1, value1), (key2, value2), ... ] do dict.items().
# you can iterate this list by doing 
# for key, value in d.items():
#   print(key, value)
#

def find_optimal_quest(d):
    
    # write your code here
    # it should return the boss with the best loot! Feel free to ask us questions :)
